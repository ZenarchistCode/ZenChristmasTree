[h1]What Is This?[/h1]

Little bit late on this one - but this is a Christmas Tree crafting mod. 

It allows players to craft their own deployable Christmas Trees by using Christmas Lights on a Wooden Log.

The Christmas tree is just a re-scaled vanilla Christmas tree - so it's super light on the scripts and assets.

Had to use some Grinchy trickery to make the mod work with some of the weirdness around scaling item sizes, so it's a little janky under the hood code-wise, but it works, is stable, and shouldn't cause any issues.

Don't forget to add the types.xml entries or they will despawn when no one is around. I recommend setting the tree to at least 1 week so it is persistent around Territory Flags - but obviously it's up to you. The kit doesn't really matter.

There is no way to get the Christmas Lights back after crafting the kit - that's intentional because on my server you can craft the Christmas Baseball Bat which has a 70% chance to one-tap zombies. 

So use your Christmas lights wisely!

The mod also includes a static object which is placeable with DayZ Editor or Admin Tools and cannot be interacted with. Here are the classnames:
- Zen_ChristmasTree_Green_Static
- Zen_ChristmasTree_Green_Kit
- Zen_ChristmasTree_Green

[h1]Installation Instructions:[/h1]

Install this mod like any other mod - copy it into your server folder and add it to your mods list. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys if you're not using a server management tool like OmegaManager which does that automatically.

This mod must be run on both server and client.

Don't forget to add the types.xml entries from inside the "extras" folder in the mod folder, or you can find them on my GitHub: www.zenarchist.com

[h1]Repack & Source Code:[/h1]

You can repack this mod if you like, and do anything else you want with it for that matter. Just keep in mind my future updates won't be applied so make sure to check back for new versions if you notice any bugs. The source code is on my GitHub at www.zenarchist.com

All my mods are free and open source, but it takes an enormous amount of time to put some of these mods together. If I've helped you out, please consider helping me buy my next coffee! I don't expect it, but I very much appreciate it.
